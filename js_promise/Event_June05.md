# Memo

* [ ] Create a KDP article on Developer Console

* [ ] Slide 23 => highlight setTimeOut

* 1 hour on Slide 43
* [] Quick break on Slide 35?

* [] Edit & upload video

## Feedback Call Notes:
* Easy to follow
* Got lost at Kintone but was able to catch up
* [] Slide on Chrome Developer Console
* Repeating the steps helped others catch up
* Show out with favorite food worked
* Add a full, bigger image of the code on the Hands-on slides
* More detailed slides through Kintone
* Do the currency API --> Do it on Nim's Side
  * Record a demo video of the currency API demo

### Asking for JS background question:
* Scale 1 to 10, what is your JavaScript background
* Follow up, tell me where you are now

### Timing
  * We want another 15 minutes
    * 2 hours & 15 minutes
  * Which points were too slow/ repeating without need?
    * Not really, it was well pace given the different level of background of the attendee's

My understanding is that only `wearUnderwear()` function is causing the `undefined` since it includes `setTimeout`.

`setTimeout` does not pass any parameters.

For more information on `setTimeout`
https://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

wearShirt('orange').then(function (shirtResponse) {
  console.log(shirtResponse);
  return wearUnderwear('white');
}).then(function (underwearResponse) {
  
  console.log(underwearResponse);
  return wearJeans('red');
}).then(function (jeansResponse) {

  console.log(jeansResponse);
}).catch(function (error) {

  console.log(error);
});
